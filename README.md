Laser bots for adaptive navigation in a static unstructured environment 

Laser bots for adaptive navigation in a static unstructured environment 

• Designed and Implemented two robots – Rotating Base station and Rover Bot.

• The robot with mounted camera follows the path provided by the Base station consisting of Laser and Servo mechanism to guide the robot across the terrain.

• Also designed the Rover bot with PID controller to follow laser beam and used image processing technique(Contour detection Algorithm)
